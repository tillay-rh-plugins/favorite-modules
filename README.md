# favorite modules

### add favorite modules panel to the clickgui

---

`*favs add <module>`
`*favs del <module>`

you can toggle modules in the favorite panel, and they will toggle globally

The panel is by default in the top left corner, you can move it to where you want. Should save fine (i had to implement custom position saving because rudherhacc go brr)
